2️⃣ Task 2: Investment Preference Analysis:
Harnessing the power of PivotTables: To effectively analyze investment preferences, I utilized Excel's PivotTable functionality. This powerful tool helped me structure and visualize the data, highlighting Equity as the most popular choice (26 investors), followed by Mutual Funds (18 investors). This suggests a potentially higher risk tolerance among investors, as Equity offers the chance for higher returns but carries greater risk.

3️⃣ Task 3: Objective and Source Analysis:
Unveiling connections with PivotTables: I used PivotTables to explore the relationship between savings objectives and information sources. The analysis revealed Capital Appreciation as the top objective (26 investors) and Financial Consultants as the most trusted source (16 investors). Interestingly, Newspapers and Magazines are dominant for Growth investors (14 out of 11).
